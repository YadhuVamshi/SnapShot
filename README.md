#### What my index.html page is?

It is the homepage of my website from where you can access other pages and I have used internal css for this whole project as it is more appealing when classes are repeating in multiple webpages.

The navigation menu consists of a series of links to different pages on the website, including the homepage, gallery, and blog. The navigation menu is contained within a div element with the class "topnav" and the ID "mytopnav". The links to the different pages are contained within anchor tags , which are styled with CSS to control their appearance and layout.
Within the "back" div, there are several other div elements that are used to style and layout the content. The "homeimg" div contains an image element that displays an image with the source "images/download (1).jpg". The "hometext" div contains a welcome message that is styled with a larger font size and a greenyellow color. The "hometextphoto" div contains a short phrase that identifies the website as a photographer's site. Finally, the "hometext1" div contains a quote about photography that is styled with a pre element. Overall, this section of the homepage appears to be designed to provide a visual and textual introduction to the website and its focus on photography.

The footer is contained within a footer element and includes a single paragraph of text. The text within the paragraph consists of a copyright notice and a reference to the website's creator, identified as "SnapShot" and styled with a green color.

#### What my gallery1.html is?

This is the heart of my project where I have arranged all the images in stacked gallery form and I have used extenive css to make it much more appealing.
Overall, the gallery page should be an engaging and visually appealing way for visitors to explore the photographer's work and learn more about their style and interests.

The grid is made up of a series of div elements with the class "column" and contains a series of img elements that display the individual images. The grid is set up so that the images are arranged in a matrix of four columns and four rows, with each column containing four images. The images are all styled with a width of 100%, which causes them to fill the width of the column they are contained in. Some of the images also have a height style applied, which controls their aspect ratio.

The grid is intended to be used as a gallery or portfolio page on a website, where visitors can browse through a selection of images. The images are likely organized into the grid to create a visually appealing layout and to make it easy for visitors to find and view the images.

#### What my finalblog.html does?

This is the page where one can access blogs. Here blog can contain tips and opinions whatsoever. It is a a place where visitors can find engaging and informative content that is relevant to the theme or purpose of the website. Here, I have shown 4 articles as examples of blogs and added extensive css to look visually appealing. Here I have included 4 article cards as examples of blogs for which I have used properties such as display flex-property and box shadow property etc.

This page contains a grid of cards that is written in HTML and styled with CSS. Each card represents an article or piece of content and is made up of a series of div and figure elements. The grid is contained within a div element with the class "site-container" and is made up of a series of article elements with the class "article-card". Each article card includes an image, contained within a figure element with the class "article-image", and some text content, contained within a div element with the class "article-content".

The text content includes a category, contained within an a element with the class "card-category", a title, contained within an h3 element with the class "card-title", and an excerpt or summary of the content, contained within a p element with the class "card-excerpt".Overall, this grid of cards is designed to display a series of articles or pieces of content in an attractive and visually appealing way.
